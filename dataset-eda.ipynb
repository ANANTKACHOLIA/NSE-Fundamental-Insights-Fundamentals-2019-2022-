This dataset encompasses over 1800 individual stocks across various sectors and segments of the market.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\nThe dataset includes a wide range of fundamental metrics that provide insights into the financial performance and health of individual companies. Some of the key features include:\n\n1. **Price/Earnings to Growth ratio (PEG):** A measure of a stock's valuation relative to its earnings growth potential.\n2. **Profit Growth:** The percentage change in a company's profits over time, indicating its growth trajectory.\n3. **Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):** The portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.\n4. **Revenue from Operations/Share:** The amount of revenue generated per share of stock outstanding.\n5. **Net Profit Margin:** The percentage of revenue that remains as net profit after accounting for all expenses.\n6. **Return on Equity (ROE):** A measure of a company's profitability relative to its shareholders' equity.\n7. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** A measure of a company's financial leverage, calculated as total debt divided by total equity.\n8. **Market Capitalization:** The total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock.\n\nHybrid Features:\n\nHybrid features combine multiple fundamental metrics to provide deeper insights into a company's financial condition and market position. These features leverage growth rates to assess the trajectory of key metrics over time and incorporate industry-relative performance to benchmark a company against its peers within the same sector. By integrating both historical trends and comparative analysis, hybrid features offer a holistic view of a company's competitive standing and growth potential.\n\n1. Growth-to-Industry Ratio: This feature calculates the ratio of a company's growth rate in a specific metric (e.g., revenue, earnings) to the average growth rate of the industry sector to which it belongs. It indicates whether the company is growing faster or slower than its industry peers.\n2. Relative Profit Margin: Combining a company's net profit margin with the average net profit margin of its industry sector, this feature assesses the company's profitability relative to its industry peers. A higher relative profit margin suggests that the company is more profitable compared to its competitors.\n3. Valuation-to-Growth Ratio: By dividing a company's Price/Earnings ratio by its earnings growth rate, this feature evaluates the company's valuation relative to its growth prospects. It helps investors assess whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued based on its growth potential.\n4. Industry Relative Return on Equity (ROE):This feature compares a company's return on equity (ROE) with the average ROE of its industry peers. It indicates how efficiently the company is utilizing its equity capital compared to its competitors.\n5. Market Cap-to-Industry Revenue Ratio: This feature divides a company's market capitalization by the average revenue from operations of its industry sector. It offers insights into the company's valuation relative to its revenue-generating capacity compared to industry benchmarks.\n6. Relative Earnings Yield: Calculated as the reciprocal of the Price/Earnings ratio, this feature compares a company's earnings yield with the average earnings yield of its industry sector. It provides a measure of the company's earnings relative to its market value compared to industry norms.\n\n**Potential Uses:**\n\n1. **Predictive Analysis:** The dataset can be used to build predictive models to forecast stock returns and future price movements. By analyzing historical fundamental metrics and stock performance, predictive algorithms can be trained to anticipate market trends and identify profitable investment opportunities.\n\n2. **Analysis of Company Wellbeing:** Investors and financial analysts can utilize the dataset to assess the financial health and wellbeing of individual companies. By examining key financial ratios and metrics, such as profitability, liquidity, and solvency, stakeholders can evaluate a company's ability to generate returns and manage risks.\n\n3. **Financial Health Metrics:** The dataset provides a wealth of financial health metrics that can be used to gauge the overall stability and performance of companies. By analyzing trends in metrics such as profit growth, earnings per share, and return on equity, analysts can assess a company's competitive position and growth prospects.\n\n4. **Statistical Relations Between Features:** Statistical analysis can be performed to explore relationships and correlations between different fundamental metrics. By examining the pairwise correlations between features, analysts can identify patterns and dependencies that may influence stock performance and valuation.\n\n5. **Sectoral Analysis:** The dataset allows for sector-wise analysis, enabling investors to compare the financial performance of companies within the same industry. By aggregating data at the sector level, analysts can identify sector-specific trends and investment opportunities.\n\n6. **Risk Management:** The dataset can be used for risk management purposes by identifying companies with high levels of debt, low profitability, or other indicators of financial distress. By assessing risk factors and mitigating exposures, investors can optimize their portfolios and minimize potential losses.\n\n7. Decision Support: In the complex and dynamic environment of financial markets, data-driven decision-making is essential for investors, portfolio managers, and financial institutions. The availability of comprehensive features empowers decision-makers with actionable insights and informed strategies for optimizing investment portfolios, mitigating risks, and maximizing returns.\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Code Description:**\n\n1. **Importing Libraries:**\n   - We begin by importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.\n   - `numpy` (imported as `np`): This library is commonly used for numerical computing and provides support for handling arrays, matrices, and mathematical operations efficiently.\n   - `pandas` (imported as `pd`): Pandas is a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
